    <p><h1>Making COMMONSpace :</h1> empowering young people to create collaboratively.</p>
    <p>
        The GoMA Youth Group (GYG) is a group of 14 young people aged 16-25 working with the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) to host a programme of events with the intention to use art to connect with communities and young people.<br>Contribute to a growing participatory exhibition at GoMA led by GYG by coming along to an event in our Summer Programme. This is a youth led series of workshops and events responding to issues chosen by local young people. You can chat to peers, make art to take home and create work to be installed in our ‘Making COMMONSpace’ exhibition at the end of the summer! This will be a space to relax, hang out, and appreciate each other’s creativity.<br>Join GYG's Dorka (@orkababa)and freelance artist Jiyoon (@jiyoonyi) for this workshop.

        ‘1, 2, 3 — hana, dul, set; 하나, 둘, 셋 / egy, kettő, három’ is a workshop exploring the relationship between body, language, and rhythm. This session utilises the universal language of gestures and sounds through rhythmic exercises and traditional dance techniques. Opening with a warm-up stretching, the session will close with slow movements and stillness.<br>
    This event is for 16-25 years old. Adults such as parents, carers, tutors, mentors and befrienders can accompany young people.
